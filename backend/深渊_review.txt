The strategy provided in the script follows a detailed approach for screening stocks based on the "深渊筑底" (Abyss Bottoming) methodology, and it's designed to identify stocks that are ready for a potential upward movement after significant downtrends. After reviewing the strategy, here are some observations and possible improvements:

### Observations:

1. **Strategy Structure**: The overall structure of the strategy is clear and follows a logical sequence of market phases. The stages for deep decline, consolidation, washout, and confirmation of lift-off are defined with specific metrics for price, volume, and pattern characteristics.

2. **Data Handling**: The script checks if the data meets the minimum length requirements and uses rolling windows for key metrics like moving averages and volume averages, which is appropriate for time-series analysis.

3. **Volume Conditions**: Volume plays a crucial role in identifying bottoms and confirming trends. However, it might be worth introducing a more flexible handling of different market conditions, especially around the "地量" (extremely low volume) condition, which might not always hold in more volatile or less liquid markets.

4. **Error Handling**: There is extensive use of exception handling throughout the code, which is important for preventing the script from crashing during execution. However, logging for errors is currently limited, which could make troubleshooting difficult if something goes wrong. It might be useful to log more detailed error messages in production or include fallback strategies when an error occurs.

5. **Buy Signal Generation**: The buy signal is only triggered once certain conditions are met, such as price behavior, volume patterns, and a confirmation candle. This makes the strategy more robust but may lead to missed opportunities if the criteria are too strict.

### Areas for Improvement:

1. **Parameter Optimization**: Some of the thresholds like `MIN_DROP_PERCENT = 0.60` (60% drop) and `PRICE_LOW_PERCENTILE = 0.15` (price in the lowest 15% of a 2-year range) might be too rigid. It might be useful to experiment with dynamic thresholds based on the market conditions or stock type. For example, different sectors may have varying volatility profiles, which can be incorporated into the strategy.

2. **Volume Conditions**: The "地量" condition (extremely low volume) is critical for the strategy, but in some market conditions, "地量" might not be as obvious. You could consider using volume-based indicators like On-Balance Volume (OBV) or Accumulation/Distribution Line to refine the volume analysis.

3. **Time Window for Price Evaluation**: The script checks for long-term price behavior (2 years) to determine if the stock is in a downtrend, which is suitable for avoiding stocks that are still in their "halfway" correction phase. However, shorter-term fluctuations might be misleading. A more flexible time window (e.g., adjusting based on historical volatility) might be helpful.

4. **Backtest Efficiency**: For each stock, the strategy executes multiple backtests and calculations. It may be helpful to make the backtesting process more efficient, especially for stocks with a large amount of historical data. Using more advanced data structures, such as resampling or aggregating the data, can help improve performance.

5. **Debugging and Testing**: The script contains several comments, such as the one about disabling detailed logging for error handling (`logger.error(f"深渊筑底策略计算失败: {e}")`). It's crucial to enable logging to a file or database for long-term tracking, especially when dealing with multiple stocks and time periods.

6. **Flexibility and Modularity**: The script uses a number of hardcoded parameters for each phase (e.g., `HIBERNATION_DAYS`, `WASHOUT_DAYS`). These could be made more dynamic by adjusting them based on market conditions or stock-specific characteristics. Modularizing the code further (e.g., breaking the logic for each phase into separate functions) would also improve maintainability.

### Suggested Improvements:

1. **Log More Information**: Enhance the logging to track the stages of the strategy for each stock and potential issues encountered. This would improve traceability during debugging and help refine the strategy over time.

2. **Volume Analysis**: Consider adding more advanced volume-based analysis, such as the OBV or A/D Line, to confirm the "地量" (low volume) structure. This will add robustness to the strategy by providing additional confirmation for trends.

3. **Flexible Parameters**: Allow for dynamic adjustment of parameters, such as the drop percentage or the low-price percentile, based on sector or historical volatility. This will make the strategy more adaptable to different market conditions.

4. **Efficient Backtesting**: For performance, consider optimizing the backtest process using multithreading or batch processing where feasible, especially for large datasets. Consider using databases for storing historical data and running backtests on pre-aggregated data.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: Test edge cases where the market data might be incomplete or have anomalies (e.g., missing volume or price data) and implement fallback strategies to handle such cases gracefully.

### Final Output:

Your script appears well-structured and has a solid foundation for screening stocks based on the "深渊筑底" strategy. With minor adjustments to the parameters, volume analysis, and error handling, it could become even more effective and adaptable to different market conditions. Let me know if you want to focus on any specific area for further refinement.
